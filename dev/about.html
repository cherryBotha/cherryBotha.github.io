                    <p><b>My name is Anuscke and I'm a Programmer and Entrepreneur in training.</b>
                        I am currently working through various projects and courses on <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a>, <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn">CodeCademy</a> and <a href="https://stoneriverelearning.com/">Stone River Elearning</a>, I'm also busy with my GED. Below I made a list of a few thing I thought you would like to know about me.

                    <div id="who_am_i"><h2>Who am I</h2>
                    <p>
                        Firstly, I'm a Christian and proud to be one, also I'm an introvert as most poeple might even say, I'm an "extroverted intovert", but I won't let that define me, yes, I'm quite at times, espcialy when I meet new people, when I'm in a group of people or say a conversation where I'm quite most of the time it's not that, I find the conversation boring, I'm just listening and taking in what is being said, then considering what to say in return.<br> I am who God made me to be, God made me who I am for a reason, He gave me specific gifts and talents and a specific personality for a reason, He also gave you specific gifts and talents with a specific personality, we just need to larn embrace it and be proud of who we are. God made each one of us uniqe, He set us apart from others, He made us to stand out from the rest.<br>

                    <h2>My hobbies</h2>
                    <p>
                        When I'm not learning about HTML, CSS and other programming languages and my other studies, I like to play guitar, by which I am actually teaching myself. I'm also teaching myself to speak Italian, it's really fun and exisiting learning a new lanuage. And finaly I'm trying learn some SASL(South African Sign Language), that is quite challengeing to learn if I do say so myself, but I love it... Plus building some fictional websites just for fun, to test or improve my coding skills. And my most favorite of all is reading books writen by Karen Kingbury, New York's number one author, I would definitly recomend reading some of her books. For me personally I love learning new things every day, growing my knowlege on my favorite topics. Life is to short just sit around and do nothing.
