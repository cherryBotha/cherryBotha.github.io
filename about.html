				<span>My name is <em>Anuscke</em> and I'm a Programmer in training</span>
				<p>I am currently working through various projects and courses on <em>Khan Academy</em> and <em>CodeCademy</em>.

I'm always up for a challenge and love trying new <em>tea's</em> and <em>coffee's</em> and also <em>I'm a christian...</em><br><br>My hobbies are reading books written by <em>famous New York Times Author Karen Kingsbury</em>, going for a jog, <em>play guitar</em> and sometimes doing some quiling.<br><br>Some of my favorite quotes are listed below:</p> 
				<ul alt="favorite quotes">
					<li>Difficult roads often lead to beautiful destinations.</li>
					<li>If it was easy anyone can do it, and you're not just anyone.</li>
					<li>After failing to climb everest a great man said, I will come again and conquer you,
						because as a mountain you cannot grow, but as a human, I can grow....</li>
					<li>Let your smile change the world, but don't let the world, change your smile.</li>
					<li>Be our own kind of beautiful.</li>
					<li>Only those I really love and love me, will ever know the real me.</li>
					<li>It always seems impossible until it's done.</li>
